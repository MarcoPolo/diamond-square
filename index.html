  <h1> Building Terrain, this might take a while. </h1>
  <p> Porting of
    <a href="http://blog.mediocregopher.com/clojure-diamond-square.html"> Brian's Diamond square algorithm </a>
    from Clojure to Clojurescript. The core function wasn't touched, yeah Clojurescript is that awesome.
    Unfortunately I had to rename core.clj to core.cljs, but that could be mitigated with cljx.
